Student Directory
=================

This was my first project during week 1 of Makers Academy. The student directory script allows you to manage the list of students enrolled on the course at Makers Academy.

Learnings
---------- 
* familarise myself with commandline, sublime text, git and basic Ruby.
* an introduction to pair programming
 

Technologies used
-----------------

* Ruby
* Github

How to use
-----------

Clone the repository:

```shell
git clone git@github.com:leopoldkwok/student-directory.git
```


Run the program without a file to load students.

```shell
cd student-directory
ruby directory.rb
```
